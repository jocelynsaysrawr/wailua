        Today, the “Fern Grotto” is a popular tourist attraction, pitched as
        “one of the most romantic spots on the island of Kaua‘i”, and often
        rented for weddings. The grotto consists of a fern covered cave which
        also acts as natural amphitheater. Because of it’s location up the
        Wailua River (south fork, near the junction), the only access there is
        by boat. Several boat companies give river tours which lead to the
        grotto. The land is part of the Wailua River State Park.{" "}

        The “Fern Grotto” site was nearly destroyed when the island of Kauaʻi
        was hit by hurricane Iniki in 1992. Most of the ferns hanging from the
        grotto were torn from the rocks and, though much of the plant life has
        rebounded, the grotto has yet to recover much of the grandeur for which
        it was previously known. In addition, on April 24, 2006, the “Fern
        Grotto” was closed by the Hawai‘i State Department of Land and Natural
        Resources for safety reasons. Heavy rains in March 2006, caused a number
        of rocks and boulders to fall from the ceiling of the Grotto onto the
        viewing area below. The site was re-opened in 2007 by the Hawai‘i
        Department of Land and Natural Resources following artificial
        reinforcement of the rock walls and installation of ramps to access to
        the grotto. Prior to the 2006 flooding visitors were allowed to enter
        the grotto. Today the grotto may only be viewed from the designated
        observation deck.

        Hoʻomanawanui (2012), points out one example of Euro-American mythmaking
        realted to “Fern Grotto”. Joesting ( ,10 )says that this area was
        associated with human sacrifice, as “after the flesh had fallen from the
        bones of the human sacrifice at Holoholokū, the remains were buried
        here” She futher states that “there is no evidence that Holoholokū or
        any of the Wailua heiau were luakini” and that The “Fern Grotto” “is not
        an ancient wahi pana”.

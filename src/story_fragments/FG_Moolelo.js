        There is a large cave in a cliff overlooking the south branch of the
        Wailua river, just above the junction with the north branch. Long
        streamers of Boston Sword surround and hand down over the opening of
        this cave giving it the contemporary name “The Fern Grotto”. The
        traditional name of this cave is Māmā-akua-Lono. The name literally
        means the chewing god lono <a>(Hoʻomanawanui)</a> or quickness of the
        god Lono.

        In one moʻolelo provided in the writings by Wailua kamaʻāina

      <br />
      <p>
        It is the home of Māmāakualono, the sister of Niolopua, the god of
        sleep. She was greatly skilled in kapa making. Her brother Niolopua
        lived in a cave on the sheer cliff of Mauna Kapu above her. She had two
        other bird kupua brothers, Kōlea and ʻŪlili, and after their deaths her
        brothers became three large pōhaku that overlook the cave.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This moʻolelo was derived from a longer version provided by Wichman{" "}
        <a>(1997, Pg 77)</a>:

      <br />
      <p>
        It is the home to a young woman named Māmā-akua-lono, who lived in this
        cave. She had three brothers, Niolopua, Kōlea and ʻŪlili. She was
        skilled in beating out strips of mulberry bark [wauke] into tapa [kapa]
        cloth. Nearby lived a woman named Hina who wanted Māmā-akua-lono to
        marry her son but the young woman refused. Hina became very angry and
        dammed up the river which slowly began to create a large reservior.
        Māmā-akua-lono did not notice this until the water happened to flow into
        her cave and began to wet her tapa. Her only escape was to jump into the
        water and attempt to swim across to the other side. As she was swimming,
        Hina broke apart the damn and the flood of water swept the young woman
        out to sea.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Māmāakualono called, in the form of a long chant, to her three brother
        to help her. Niolopua heard his sister and he sent his two brothers,
        Kōlea and ʻUlili in their bird forms to watch over Māmā-akua-lono while
        he prayed to the god Lono to protect and save her.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        His long prayer moved the god, and he brought her ashore on Oʻahu where
        he crept among some pōhuehue (morning glory vine) and fell asleep. Two
        women found here tehre and brought her to be a wifre to their brother
        Mokuʻula. Māmāakualono began to beat out tapa until her new house was
        filled with thousands of articles of clothing and bedding. Then she left
        and returned to Wailua and her cave, where she lived until she died.
        Lono turned the three brothers into rocks where they could keep watch
        over their sister as she lived in her cave and make sure Hina never
        dammed up the river again.

        Niolopua was the name of a heiau and it belonged to Niolopua. Here is a
        short story pertaining to it:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Niolopua was a man. His sister was Maamaakualono and she was fond of
        beating out tapa clothes. Her brother’s wife watched her and wanted to
        try. She asked her husband to ask his sister to giver her something to
        do and so he went to this sister and beg work for her sister-in-law, who
        prepared a strip of wauke bark and gave it to her sister-in-law. That
        was the time whhen the water rushed into her house and carried her out
        to sea. She looked ashore, love welled up for her brother and she wailed
        aloud. She raised her voice and chanted. (The chant is forgotten.)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The brother heard his sister’s voice and creid out to her:</p>
      <br />
      <p>I am Niolopua, the brother</p>
      <p>We two dwelt on the hillside of Konolea</p>
      <p>We wandered into the brush</p>
      <p>Looking down to the sea of Kalehuawehe</p>
      <p>You relased, you relased the birds</p>
      <p>To seek a trail along the cliff</p>
      <p>The plover that went to the mountain water sources,</p>
      <p>The sandpiper that pecks the seafoam,</p>
      <p>Swimming together to the open spaces;</p>
      <p>The varicoled lehua blossoms were worn as wreaths</p>
      <p>When I dwelt on the plain of Haili,</p>
      <p>What would I have done without affection,</p>
      <p>As a twisted vine is without brow [to wear it?]</p>
      <p>The brow is bent over with humiliation,</p>
      <p>My body is filled with endless pity.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When he ceased wailing his sister was borne out of sight ofland and
        arrived in Hawaii, maybe in Kohala. When she reached shore she crept
        among some pohuehue vines, where, warmed by the sun, she fell asleep.
        Two women came along the sore and saw something brown among the pōhuehue
        vines and wen they looked at it closely they found that it was a woman
        and wondered if she was pretty. One of the women said, “Maybe her back
        is goodlooking and her face is ugly.” They woke her up and stared at
        her. They saw o blemish nor disfiguration and so they took her home. She
        became the wife of Mokuʻula.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        She told her husband at once tot build a house and fence it all around.
        The husband did it right away and she began to beat tapas, till the
        huose was filled with them. That was the wealth in olden times. After
        that a woman came into the house and saw it filled and knew that this
        was wealth for the house was full. She left her husband and returned to
        Kauaʻi where she lived until her death.{" "}

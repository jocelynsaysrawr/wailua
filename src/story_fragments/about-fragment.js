        For over twenty years, Kaua‘i has been portraited and branded in the
        tourism industry as the “Island of Discovery,” or more recently the
        “Island of Rejuvenation” where both themes elicit a sense of excitement,
        exoticism, “native” hospitality, romanticism, perfection, and nostalgia
        promoting the commodification of Native Hawaiian culture.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The lands of Wailua in the Puna district on Kauaʻi island were lived in
        over the course of generations. They were once known and recognized as a
        sacred wahi pana, home to some of Kauaʻi’s highest ranking aliʻi
        (royals) with highlighted features and place names celebrated in oral
        traditions. However, over the past century and a half, the traditional
        narratives for Wailua that gave this place and its community identity
        has been transformed by settler colonial outside interests, with the
        tourism industry driving the creation of its image and sense of place.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Wailua is the largest of the fifteen windward ahupuaʻa (socio-political
        land units) that comprise the district of Puna and contains 20,255 acres
        that was once divided into two parts, Wailua Makai, which contained
        2,800 acres and Mauka. Wailua Makai was known as Wailua-nui-ʻaho-ano and
        was the seat of political power as well as one of the most sacred
        regions for the Kauaʻi chiefdom.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As important wahi pana (storied place), it is unique in the sense that
        it has the longest navigable river (32 km) in our homeland, formed by
        the confluence of its north and south forks and numerous permanent and
        semi-permanent streams and tributaries that begin near Waiʻaleʻale, the
        wettest spot on Earth and that drains into a vast productive inland
        agricultural region.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Along the major geographical feature, Wailua River, are alluvial flats
        which were once used for agricultural cultivation in the prehistoric
        period, found along with a number of significant sacred sites and
        features, including burials, heiau, birthing stones (Pōhaku hānau), a
        bell stone (Pōhaku kani), fishponds (Loko i‘a), canoe landings (Pae
        Wa‘a), and petroglyphs (Ki‘i pōhaku: Pae Ki‘i Mahu) some of which can
        still be seen today.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The five focus sites highlighted within the Wailua ahpuaʻa are
        considered the highest “places of impact” that are under immediate
        threat currently being well-known sites of increased amounts of
        exposure, recreation, impact and/ or traffic. These sites include,
        Opaekaʻa Falls (Wai-olo-io), Fern Grotto (Māmā-akua-lono), Wailua Beach,
        Wailua River, and Lydgate Beach Park.

      <h2 className="underlined">The Name Wailua</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In examining the place name, there are several possible translations for
        the word Wailua. First, the name Wailua is a compound word that can be
        broken up into two <strong>terms:</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em className="italic">Wai,</em> which means fresh water
      </p>
      <p>
        <em className="italic">Lua,</em> means two or double (Puku‘i 1986).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {" "}
        While it is believed that the name speaks of the abundance of rainfall
        and freshwater in the region, the name Wailua is most commonly and
        locally known for its literal meaning “two waters” referring to the two
        branches/ forks that become one a mile upstream from the ocean in
        Wailua.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For Instance, Walter Smith (1955), kama‘āina (native-born) of this
        region, wrote that “Wailua means two waters into one, or two branches
        running to the sea by one outlet”.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Another definition was written by Ethel Damon (1931: 360) as “water pit”
        referring to the pools at the bottom of several waterfalls along the
        river's course.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, as Hoʻomanawanui (2012: 192) explains, this rudimentary
        definition is unsatisfactory from an indigenous perspective. According
        to Pukuʻi & Elbert (1986), Wailua also means spirit, ghost; or remains
        of the dead.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Wichman (1998) discusses the spiritually connected meaning of Wailua to
        leina (leaping point of spirits into Pō). He writes:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="italic">
        <strong>
          “Spirits of the dead indeed gathered together on the upland plains and
          on certain moonlit nights marched in great processions accompanied
          with drums and nose flutes down to the river. These night marchers
          entered waiting canoes and paddled down the river into the sea and
          around the coast until they reached Polihale at Mānā. Here they leaped
          from the cliffs into Pō, the land of the dead, which lay beneath the
          sea” (Wichman 1998: 67–68).
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition, he also mentions that wairua (spirit, soul) is a place name
        in Aotearoa (New Zealand), including the name of a major river. Rerenga
        Wairua in Aotearoa is a leaping place for spirits into the afterworld,
        and when rendering the name into Hawaiian, Rerenga Wairua correlates to
        the Hawaiian term Ka Leina Wailua, literally, “The Spirit Leaping Place”
        (Ho‘omanawanui 2012: 193).

      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        As Intensification of settlement occured through the generations of
        aliʻi nui living in Wailua, there was also an increasing population and
        thus, increased pressure for food resources.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        During the pre-contact times agricultural intensification in Wailua was
        done through the large-scale production system of irrigated agriculture
        (cultivated taro), which is suggested to have contributed its
        development as the seat of political power.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        Documented Western contact at Wailua was made by Captain Gorge Vancouver
        in 1793. Vancouver observations noted Wailua as:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        <em className="italic">

      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        Maps from 1850 to 1900 indicate that taro continued to be grown along
        the Wailua River with some conversion to rice by 1935. Many of those
        growing rice were immigrant Chinese and Japanese who had their contract
        on the nearby sugar plantations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="centered">
        Rice, like taro, was an irrigated crop and the system was modified with
        expanded ‘auwai and flumes. It appears that rice fields recorded in 1900
        were all previous taro fields.
      </p>
      <br />

        Today, the rice and taro fields on the alluvial terraces along the river

        A fair calm weather wind the blows coldly all night from about 10 pm. To
        7 a.m. Sometimes it blows in the afternoon. White ʻōpua clouds are blown
        seaward over Wailua from Wai‘ale‘ale. When the ʻōpua spread over the
        land in the early morning it is called uhi wai (water covering, e.g.
        heavy mist). Since it is calm, akule, ‘øpelu, ‘ø ‘io, moi and such fish
        may be caught.

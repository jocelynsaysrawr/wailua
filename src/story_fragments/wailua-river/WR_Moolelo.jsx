        Wailua River is rich with history and appears in many moʻolelo. Some of
        the most famous being:

      <p>
        One problem can be seen with mo‘olelo however, and that is, it is not a
        fixed text where the words are freer and more interchangeable. Whereas,
        place names, oli, mele, and ʻōlelo no‘eau are more strict and the words
        and are usually unchanged. Therefore, rather than focusing on mo‘olelo
        of Wailua River, I instead focus on the famed places of Wailua River
        then closely at the oli, mele within the moʻolelo as well as the ʻōlelo
        noʻeau.

        This ʻōlelo noʻeau speaks of the numerous streams and tributaries along
        the north and south forks of the Wailua river.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>The Upper North Branch of the Wailua River</strong> drainage
        basin is 17.9 square miles and its source is the base of Wai‘ale‘ale &
        Kawaikini. Major streams on this North Branch include Keāhua,
        ʻUhauʻiole, Kāwī and Kalama
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Some of the most famed placed along the Wailua river include:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Ka-lua-hole</strong> the beginning portion of the north fork of
        the Wailua river, just before it joins the south fork. The name
        literally means the pond where there are āhole fish. The water comes
        from Wai‘ale‘ale, through Pihanakalani and Ka-ehu gulch and is fed by
        Hahau-‘iole, Wailua-iki, and Waiahole. Ka-lua-hole is also the name of
        the smallest taro patch in the valley which, however, was famed for
        producing the finest taro. (Dickey, Ka‘iu, DAGS Map 146) Hahauʻiole is a
        stream and waterfall whose headwaters drain the slopes of Maheo on the
        Hanalei border and flows into the Wailua river just above the junction
        of Wailua and Ke-ahua stream. The name means rat-smiting and may have a
        connotation of the game{" "}

        </a>
        . The name would also bring to mind the exploits of the famous archer
        Pikoi and Puapua-lenalena, the dog that taught him many of his hunting
        skills. This is also the site of an ancient village, where villagers
        would go to the sea at Wailua, catch fish, dry them, and return to the
        mountains (Kaʻiu).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are three waterfalls along the upper north branch,{" "}
        <strong>Kapapa-iki, Kapapanui, and Koholālele.</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Koholālele</strong> the waterfall in the north branch of Wailua
        river. The name literally means leaping whale. Koholālele is also a
        large pond dammned to flood high taro patches. This Is the middle of
        Ka-lua-hole branch between Ka-malu and Pu‘upilo. (Kaneka, Ka‘iu, Pukui
        and Elbert)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Wai-hu‘ahu‘a</strong> is a river section of the north fork of
        the Wailua river between Pu‘upilo and ‘A‘ahoaka. The name literally
        means foaming water. (Ka‘iu)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Kawī</strong> is a stream that flows from the Makaleha mountains
        into the north branch of the Wailua river (Sorehen). The waterfall of
        Kawī stream is named Moalepe or Cock’s comb. Along Kawī stream is an
        ancient hau grove (papu hau or ulu hau) called <strong>Kaʻehu</strong>{" "}
        (the spray) that was said to have been about 50 acres fed by the{" "}
        <strong>Kaukua</strong> stream (Kaʻiu). Kuakua is the name of the stream
        that flows into Kawī stream and is the waters that feeds the hau grove
        of Kaʻehu (Kaʻiu). <strong>Kuakua</strong> is literally anvil for
        beating kapa.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>The Upper South Branch of Wailua River</strong> include the
        major tributaries and streams of{" "}
        <strong>
          Hāliʻi, ʻIli-ʻili-ʻula, Ka-ulu, Pali-kea, Wai-ahi, Wai-aka, Wai-koko,
          ʻOpeʻopeʻilio,
        </strong>{" "}
        lastly and the most famed, <strong>Kawelowai</strong>, also a place
        above Wailua Falls which has several legends associated with it (Kaʻiu,
        Cultural Surveys Hawaiʻi).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Along the lower half of the Wailua River are also famed places.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Makena</strong> is a pūnāwai (spring) at the bottom of the
        river. According to LCA 1915, it was “above the poi factory.” Makena
        means remembrance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Malu-aka</strong> a is the land area up the south fork a little
        ways. Malu means stillness and awe of kapu, aka is the essence of an
        offering. This is where the hau of Malu-ala first grew and spread along
        the banks. Ka‘iu says, however, that this place is at Wai-olo-io. These
        hau flowers, in particular, do not ordinarily float away but eddy around
        and around until the wind of Wai-opua comes when they are gathered in
        the middle of the river and then travel in a long procession down to
        Hauola. (Dickey, Ka‘iu)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Molo-hua</strong> is an area just north of the river mouth. The
        name literally means traveling flower.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Manamana-i-aka-luea</strong> was a known lehua tree in ancient
        times. This was the lehua tree that never bore flowers and grew across
        the river from Māmā-akua-lono. All its flowers appeared in the water and
        floated down stream and could be seen under the water at the surf of
        Ka-luawehe, in the sea fronting Hauola. Emerson, however, says the
        flowers floated to Lehua-wehe. (Emerson, Dickey)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Ke-kukui-ala-o-Kamaʻalau</strong> was a grove of Kukui trees,
        now gone. The place name literally means, the fragrant kukui grove of
        Kama‘alau. This grove stood just above the junction of the two branches
        of the Wailua river. Kama‘a-lau the leaf sandal, was a kupua brother of
        his kupua sister Pohāku, now also a stone in the water next to
        Waiolo-io, a pond in the river itself. Pōhaku is a variegated reddish
        stone in the stream by the hau trees. The other of these guardians of
        the river is from 30 to 50 feet away. Another mo‘olelo in relation to
        this place name is about a brother and sister who stole bananas from the
        patch of Palila on the top of Makaleha. Palila chased and nearly caught
        them, but the sister jumped into the water and became a stone and the
        brother jumped to one side of the stream and also became a stone.
        Lastly, about halfway up the river, there is a sharp pointed rock
        formation, almost like a needle-like. It is related to a rock that
        apparently floats in the bottom of the river. A chief fell in love with
        a commoner woman, but they were not permitted to marry. The gods took
        pity and they changed him into the rock on the side of the ridge and the
        woman into the rock that floats in the river.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Papa-ʻalae</strong> was a fishpond for ali‘i on the North Bank
        of the Wailua River between the river mouth and Holoholokū. Papa‘alae
        means a great many ‘alae birds. This is where Maui forced the ‘alae bird
        to give him the secret of obtaining fire from sticks. The stone
        fireplace where the ‘alae bird made their fire was pointed out, and the
        hill behind where the suspicious and crafty old bird ascended to make
        sure that no curious eavesdroppers were in sight, and the sweet potato
        patch in with Maui hid, half submerged in a hole to watch the
        performance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Ka-lua-Mokila</strong> is a cave that runs under Pu‘ukī hill
        from Holoholokū. Mokila, a mo‘o, gathered all the precious stones of
        Kaua‘i into this cave where he lived. When two men tried to steal one of
        the gems, the mo‘o killed many people in his anger. Then he decided it
        was better to leave Kaua‘i with all his gems, and that is why there are
        no precious stones on Kaua‘i. Another mo‘olelo stated in times of war,
        the women and children belonging to the ruling family were hidden in
        this cave. One end of the cave was inside the temple of Ka-lei-o-manu
        and the other opens directly onto the river. Now much of the cave has
        fallen in and it is very dangerous to go in it.

        The brackish water of Wailua river would seem like a strange place to
        find sharks. Yet numerous mo‘olelo tell of at least three sharks that
        lived there. Kū-hai-moana, Kauela, and Kawelo-mahamaha-iʻa.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kū-hai-moana is a shark god who could also take the form of a man, and
        was often seen working in his lo‘i kalo up the river. According to
        Dickey, whenever a group of people passed him on their way to the sea to
        fish, Kū-hai-moana would ask them where they were going. If they were
        going visiting, he never replied, but if they were going fishing, he
        would say “Good luck!” After they passed, he would change into a shark
        form, swim down river and go out to sea to catch an unsuspecting victim
        for his meal.The people could not kill Kū-hai-moana, since he was a god,
        but they learned to never tell anyone they were going fishing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kauela, is another shark who used to live in the cave near the mouth.
        The present-day cement bridge was built over it and Kauela has had to
        find a new home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Kawelo-mahamaha-i‘a was the Mōʻī of Kauaʻi during the 17th century. He
        is responsible for reintroducing the pi‘o rank, the highest possible
        rank because the child was the product of a marriage between brother and
        sister. If the shadow of a pi‘o fell on an object, the object then
        belonged to the pi‘o; if the shadow fell on a living thing; it was
        killed. Usually pi‘o went outdoors only at night. Because of this, after
        his death, stories grew that Kawelo-mahamaha-i‘a was part shark/ part
        man and in his shark form lived in his house shaped rock.{" "}
        <strong>Ka-hale-o-Kawelomahamaha-i‘a</strong> is a large house-shaped
        stone in the river below the cave of Māmā-akua-lono near the junction of
        the two branches of Wailua and a large stone on the shore. Both are
        somewhat shaped like a grass house. Both are called{" "}
        <strong>Ka-hale-o-Kawelo-mahamaha-i‘a.</strong>

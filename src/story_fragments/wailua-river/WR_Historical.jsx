        In 1845, significant changes in Hawaiʻi’s traditional land tenure system
        occurred when the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles was
        established. The Board, known informally as the Land Commission, was
        created “for the investigation and final ascertainment or rejection of
        all claims of private individuals, whether natives or foreigners, to any
        landed property” (Chinen 1958:8). The Organic Acts of 1845 and 1846
        continued the course of the Māhele, which took place in 1848 and
        introduced the concept of private property into Hawaiian society. Lands
        were divided into three portions: Crown Lands which amounted to roughly
        a million acres of land for the King, Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli) and
        the royal house; Government Lands which were approximately a million and
        a half acres set aside to generate revenue for the government; and
        Konohiki Lands, lands claimed by aliʻi and their konohiki, which
        amounted to about a million and a half acres. However, for these
        particular lands title was not awarded until the aliʻi or konohiki
        presented the claim before the Land Commission.

        In the Fall of 1850, legislation was passed allowing native tenants to
        present claims before the Land Commission for lands that they were
        living on and cultivating within the Crown, Government, or Konohiki
        lands. The process for which native tenants could acquire fee simple
        property interest in land included providing personal testimonies
        regarding their residency and land use practices. These testimonies
        provide first-hand accounts with specific information such as people and
        place names associated with certain lands. By 1855, the Land Commission
        had made visits to all the islands and their work finally ended. Between
        9,000 and 11,000 land claims were awarded to native tenants totaling
        only about 30,000 acres. Lands awarded to native tenants became known as
        Kuleana Lands and all the awards were categorized as Land Commission
        Awards (LCA) and were given Helu, or numbers.

        In Wailua, a total of 25 Land Commission Awards were were granted to
        both natives and foreigners. These documents are an incredibly rich
        “slice of life” for this time period in the Hawaiian Islands. The Māhele
        documents are often researched by those interested in land use, however,
        these documents include the history of the people here in Hawai`i, and
        their attachment to the sea and the land at that time.

        Majority of the LCA claims were in the makai portion of Wailua.
        Generally a heavy concentration of LCAs were within the vicinity of what
        we know now as the old Coco Palms Hotel, along th edges of the makai
        porrtion of Wailua river and Wailua river mouth, and stretching back
        towards the ʻŌpekaʻa falls location. There were also some LCAs located
        up the Wailua River. From translation and calculation, this general
        cocentration area in the makai portion contained at over 24 pahale
        (house sites), over approximately 150 lo‘i, and two fishponds by the
        names of Laealakukui & Weuweukawaiiki (LCA 3111, 3556).

        As important wahi pana (storied place), it is unique in the sense that
        it has the longest and only navigable river (32 km) in our homeland.
        Wailua river is formed by the confluence of its north and south forks
        that contain numerous permanent and semi-permanent streams and
        tributaries that begin near Waiʻaleʻale, the wettest spot on Earth. This
        interior of Kauaʻi sustains very high rain fall averageing 146 inches
        per year (3708.4 rom) and drains into a vast productive inland
        agricultural region.

        Along the this major geographical feature, Wailua River, are alluvial
        flats which were once used for agricultural cultivation in the
        prehistoric period, found along with a number of significant sacred
        sites and features. Historic Maps provide us with the names of these
        areas of cultivation along the rivers edges (not LCA claimed) up the
        Wailua river till a little past the North and South Forks. These lands
        include{" "}
        <strong>
          Konolea, Makea, Hamoa, Kamalau, Eke, Ululoa, Makailiahi, Ulua,
          Kaluaahole (Kaluahole)
        </strong>{" "}
        which all once culivated kalo.{" "}

        An evaluation of historical maps from 1850 to 1900 indicate that kalo
        continued to be grown along the Wailua River with some conversion to
        rice by 1935. Many of those growing rice were immigrant Chinese and
        Japanese who had their contract on the nearby sugar plantations. Rice,
        like taro, was an irrigated crop and the system was modified with
        expanded ‘auwai and flumes. It appears that rice fields recorded in 1900
        were all pervious taro fields (Yent 1989:3). Today, the rice and taro
        fields on the alluvial terraces along the river have become pasture
        lands.

        In 1845, significant changes in Hawaiʻi’s traditional land tenure system
        occurred when the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles was
        established. The Board, known informally as the Land Commission, was
        created “for the investigation and final ascertainment or rejection of
        all claims of private individuals, whether natives or foreigners, to any
        landed property”{" "}

        . The Organic Acts of 1845 and 1846 continued the course of the Māhele,
        which took place in 1848 and introduced the concept of private property
        into Hawaiian society. Lands were divided into three portions: Crown
        Lands which amounted to roughly a million acres of land for the King,
        Kamehameha III (Kauikeaouli) and the royal house; Government Lands which
        were approximately a million and a half acres set aside to generate
        revenue for the government; and Konohiki Lands, lands claimed by aliʻi
        and their konohiki, which amounted to about a million and a half acres.
        However, for these particular lands title was not awarded until the
        aliʻi or konohiki presented the claim before the Land Commission.

        In the Fall of 1850, legislation was passed allowing native tenants to
        present claims before the Land Commission for lands that they were
        living on and cultivating within the Crown, Government, or Konohiki
        lands. The process for which native tenants could acquire fee simple
        property interest in land included providing personal testimonies
        regarding their residency and land use practices. These testimonies
        provide first-hand accounts with specific information such as people and
        place names associated with certain lands. By 1855, the Land Commission
        had made visits to all the islands and their work finally ended. Between
        9,000 and 11,000 land claims were awarded to native tenants totaling
        only about 30,000 acres. Lands awarded to native tenants became known as
        Kuleana Lands and all the awards were categorized as Land Commission
        Awards (LCA) and were given Helu, or numbers.

        In Wailua, claims mention 53 ʻāpana of which 51 were awarded. These LCAs
        were granted to both natives and foreigners. These documents are an
        incredibly rich “slice of life” for this time period in the Hawaiian
        Islands. The Māhele documents are often researched by those interested
        in land use, however, these documents include the history of the people
        here in Hawai`i, and their attachment to the sea and the land at that
        time.

        Majority of the LCA claims were in the makai portion of Wailua.
        Generally, a heavy concentration of LCAs was within the vicinity of what
        we know now as the old Coco Palms Hotel, along the edges of the makai
        portion of Wailua river and Wailua river mouth, and stretching back
        towards the ʻŌpekaʻa falls location. There were also some LCAs located
        up the Wailua River. From translation and calculation, this general
        concentration area in the makai portion contained at over 24 pahale
        (house sites), over approximately 150 lo‘i, 8 kula (more than a dozen
        pastures by name) and two fishponds by the names of Laealakukui &
        Weuweukawaiiki (LCA 3111, 3556),{" "}

        As important wahi pana (storied place), it is unique in the sense that
        it has the longest and only navigable river (32 km) in our homeland.
        Wailua river is formed by the confluence of its north and south forks
        that contain numerous permanent and semi-permanent streams and
        tributaries that begin near Waiʻaleʻale, the wettest spot on Earth. This
        interior of Kauaʻi sustains very high rainfall averaging 146 inches per
        year (3708.4 rom) and drains into a vast productive inland agricultural
        region.

        Along this major geographical feature, Wailua River, are alluvial flats
        which were once used for agricultural cultivation in the prehistoric
        period, found along with a number of significant sacred sites and
        features. Historic Maps provide us with the names of these areas of
        cultivation along the river's edges (not LCA claimed) up the Wailua
        river till a little past the North and South Forks. These lands include{" "}

          Konolea, Makea, Hamoa, Kamalau, Eke, Ululoa, Makailiahi, Ulua,

        An evaluation of historical maps from 1850 to 1900 indicate that kalo
        continued to be grown along the Wailua River with some conversion to
        rice by 1935. Many of those growing rice were immigrant Chinese and
        Japanese who had their contract on the nearby sugar plantations. Rice,
        like taro, was an irrigated crop and the system was modified with
        expanded ‘auwai and flumes. It appears that rice fields recorded in 1900
        were all pervious taro fields{" "}

        river have become pasture lands.

        The beach of Wailua is famous in story such as Hi‘iaka’s arrival on the
        shores in search of Lohi‘au or Puna-nui-ka-ia-ʻāina with his entourage
        and as the first known navigators to settle in Wailua.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The beach has also been identified by other names over the centuries. In
        some mo‘olelo it is called <strong>Alio.</strong>

      <p className="italic indented">
        Kāne, greastest of the Hawaiian god, created the earth and covered it
        with plants and animals. Beside the beach of <strong>Aliʻo</strong> at
        Wailua, he planted a garden, Ka-lana-i -hau-ola, The altr for offerings
        of life. Taking sand from the beach and red dirt from the uplands, Kāne,
        with his brothers kū and Lono, shaped an image with head, body, hands,
        and legs like themsevles and the gods brought it to life. This first man
        they named him Kumuhonua, Beggining earth. The god also created a wife
        for him, Lalo-honua, Earth below. These two lived in Ka-lana-i-hau-ola
        until they broke Kāne’s law. Kāne, in the form of a great white
        albatross, drove them away from the garden.

        The first man and woman made by the gods were fashioned from the sands

        Alio (or <strong>Walio</strong>) is the sandy beach area between the
        Wailua river mouth that extends south to the area of Nukoliʻi (Kukole),
        boardering the neighboring ahupua‘a of Hanamaʻulu.

        In some mo‘olelo, it was called <strong>Kemamo,</strong> and was a
        favorite landing for Kaua‘i in traditional times. Kemamo literally means
        the descendant.

        According to Kamakau (1867:1), <strong>Wai-māhanalua</strong> is the
        name of a stream. Literally, it means stream of twim pits. Wai-māhanalu
        is where Moʻikeha lands his canoe when he arrives in Wailua (Kamakau,
        1867:1). It is also the name of a canoe landing near Makaʻiwa (Bacon &
        Näpökä, 1995: 67). This is possibly why Beckwith (1918:364) identifies
        the beach landing as “Kamakaiwa”.

      <p>Kamakau’s Version of Kila’s Voyage to Tahiti:</p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        Mo‘ikeha sent all three sons to Tahiti to bring La‘a to Hawai‘i.
        Mo‘ikeha had designated La‘a, the first born, as heir to his lands and
        titles. The youngest son Kila was placed in command of the canoe, the
        same one Mo‘ikeha himself sailed from Kahiki to Kaua‘i. “He first taught
        Kila the way to sail over the ocean and to study the stars….” After
        departure, the canoe was becalmed off Malae Point in Wai‘anae and Kila
        and his two brothers met Poka‘i and Mo‘eke, two of Mo‘ikeha crew members
        from the voyage to Hawai‘i. When asked about his father, Kila replied:
        “He is enjoying surfing at the stream mouth, body surfing from morning
        to night on the waves of <strong>Ka‘ohala</strong> in the sheltered calm
        of
        <strong>Waimahanalua</strong> – the openness of <strong>Kewa</strong>{" "}
        and its swaying kalukalu – the two hills that bear Puna like a child in
        arms – the diving place at <strong>Waiehu</strong> where the taro grows
        as big as ‘ape – the curling of the waves at <strong>Makaiwa</strong> –
        his beautiful wife, my mother Ho‘oipo-i-ka-malanai. Mo‘ikeha will die on
        Kaua‘i; he will not return to Kahiki lest his feet be wet by the sea.”
      </p>
      <br />

        According to <strong>Fornander, Wai-māhana-lu</strong> is also named as
        a Beach somewhere between Wailua and Kapaʻa:

      <p>
        Hoʻomanawanui (2012) cites a mele by Emersion (1997b, pp. 135-137),
        highlighting eight places named, including two famous surf sites,
        Makaīwa and Kalehuawehe, loacted in Wailua bay. Furthermore, “Pana
        noʻeau already discussed, such as the surf of Makaīwa and the kalukalu
        grass of Kēwā and Wailuanuihoʻāno, lend a heightened poetic aesthetic to
        the mele”.

        <strong>Ka-maka-iwa,</strong> was the most well know in moʻolelo as the
        famous place for riding the surf. It is believed that surfbarding was
        created here. There were two kinds of surf boards: a short one for
        easily sliding in and out of the waves, and a long one. An expert could
        catch a large wave and ride it into broad waters of the muliwai, the
        pond behind the river mouth (Dickey, Fornander).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Ka-maka-iwa literally means the mother of pearl eyes. Interestingly,
        Maka‘iwa was aso the mother of pearl eyes on wooden images. However,
        figuratively Maka-iwa is the eyes of the Frigate bird.

      <p>Additionally, Dickey writes about Makaiwa and states:</p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        Hina dreamed of surf-riding here and came from Tahiti to find the man of
        her dreams. Ka-‘ili-lau-o-ke-koa, granddaughter of Mo‘ikeha was a famous
        surfer. Kapo-‘ula-kina‘u also surfed here with the eight young men who

        <strong>Lua Wehe</strong>, is a surf sport south of Wailua. The name
        literally means hole where fish can be found. It is also thought to be a
        traditional fishing ground.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are fishing grounds outside of the surf of Makaiwa as far as
        Wailua. In 1885, a Lahainaluna student (who was not named) wrote of
        these traditional fishing grounds in both English and Hawaiian. These 24
        traditional fishing grounds are named as Hipa, Kua, Muliwai, Kaohapuu,
        Kalaeloa, Kahape, Kauila, Kuwi, Kahaiki, Makaopapala, Maumau, Ukeke,
        Hanue, Koki, Kapue, Kalue, Uleiwa, Kalaelou-luna, Kokoli, Kalaeloa-lalo,
        Kaluakoi, Koukapuu, Nana, Kanaha. However, the content from this
        student’s contribution gives very specific details to location, to
        respect families that have fished in this area in generations before,
        this information about these traditional fishing grounds will not be
        shared on this site.

        <strong>Lehua-wehe</strong> is the ocean segment near the mouth of the
        Wailua. The name literally means open lehua blossoms. It is said that
        lehua blossoms that floated down the river from
        <strong>Manamanaiakaluea</strong> collected here and eddied in a great
        circle (Dickey).
      </p>

        Near the river mouth are the{" "}

        Line of rocks to the south of Wailua river mouth along the shore,
        frequently under water. Stretching north across the mouth of Wailua
        river from Hau-ola is a line of rocks with strange markings on them that
        may be seen when the rocks are exposed and dry. They are said to have
        formed part of the wall of the city of refuge when the course of the
        river was different. There are paikaiʻi or pictured rocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the most well know moʻolelo associated to these Pae-kiʻi

          When Maui was trying to pull all the island together, people cheering
          from the shore commented on the beautiful in the bac of the canoe.
          Mauiʻs eight brothers, although forbidden to do so, turned to look.
          The large fish Maui had caught broke away and the islands never became
          landmass. The brothers were turned to stone and placed across the
          river mouth. (Dickey){" "}

        Other place names associated to Wailua beach include{" "}
        <strong>Kikake,</strong> a point on the seacoast used to mark the
        boundry between Olohena and Wailua ahupuaʻa (Alex 1900). Another is{" "}
        <strong>Ka-ʻaui-o-Puna,</strong> or the turning of Puna. When Kawelo’s
        canoe arrived on the shores of Wailua to avenge the death of his
        parents, ʻAikanaka’s messenger failed to realized Kawelo was on board,
        since he was rolled up in a mat. As the canoe was carried ashore,
        Kawelo’s younger borther’s slipped and dislouged the mat. Kawelo stooed
        in the prow if the canoe and plied his war club on both killing several
        of the enemy (Akina).

      <p>
        It is important to note that there are many versions of this story of
        Kawelo (like many other mo’olelo), and depending on the orator or
        author, time period and understanding to place, each tell their version
        of the story for different purposes and meanings.

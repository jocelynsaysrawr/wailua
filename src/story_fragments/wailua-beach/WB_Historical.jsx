        The wide bay of Wailua would have provided the best landing point along
        the windward coast of Kaua‘i. It was noted that in 1799, Vancouer landed
        here. A canoe landing at the north end of the beach was called{" "}
        <strong>Kapua‘iomalahua,</strong> which was also used as a steamer
        landing in the 19th century (Dole, 1929, p. 10). The name was provided
        from The Garden Island Newspaper (November 28, 1916, p.7) stating:

        They landed at Kapua’iomalahua, at the north end of the beach at Wailua
        (that being the usual landing for steamers in those days

        In 1877, a letter about the Hui Kawaihau sugar planters, J. H. K.
        Keliioniwalemaino of Kapahi also references the beach as{" "}
        <strong>“Ke one loa o Wailua”</strong> or “The long sands of Wailua” (Ka
        Lahui Hawai‘i, June 28, 1877, p. 3).

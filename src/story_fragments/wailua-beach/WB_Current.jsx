        Wailua Beach is highlighted in travel guidebooks and advertised online
        for its easy accessibility to the highway. It is also a known spot
        frequented with surfers and kite boarders. Although, social media
        platforms currently promote the beach itself for its picturesque
        qualities, the conditions of the waters are not ideal for swimming. The
        waters of this beach are generally murky and the sandbar close to the
        shore causes the waves to break. Powerful rip currents develop when surf
        is high. Sand accumulates at the rivers’ mouth when the flow of the
        river is low. When the river flow increases, the sand is pushed back out
        to sea. However, it is not a good idea to swim at or near the river’s
        mouth, as the bottom drops off quickly, the currents can be treacherous.

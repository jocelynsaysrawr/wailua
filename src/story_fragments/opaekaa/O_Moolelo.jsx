        While this name is not found on historical maps or in any of the
        currently digitized nupepa, it is thought that in this context
        Wai-olo-io could be in relation to the attributes of this particular
        waterfall after a large rain. The steady flow of water can swiftly move
        into rushing heavy brown waters.

        This pool was named for a moʻo who sometimes assumed the form of a

        In 1915 Judge Lyle Dickey, mentioned the name of this waterfall is
        <em className="underlined">Wai-olo-io.</em>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Similarly, another document found in the State Archives written by Issac
        Ka‘iu (1,p.524) also confirms this statement writing:
      </p>
      <p className="indented">
        Opae-kaa waterfall, wrong name got by county; right name is Wai-ʻo-loio
        Falls. Opae-kaa is below the waterfall pond, a stream below. Mauka is
        Kuamoo stream. The whole place there is Kuamoo. Below the waterfall is
        Ka-ʻili-ʻili, a stream crossed by a horse-trail. O[r] by{" "}
        <em className="underlined">one</em> stream but diff. names. ʻOpae-kaa is
        nearby Wao-ʻoloio waterfall, and Kaʻiliʻili is going makai side, all ala
        [?] rock and horse crosses there.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        According to Pukui, Mary Kawena, Samuel H. Elbert and Esther T. Mookini,
        Wai is water, and <em className="italic">‘olo ‘io</em> means to move
        swiftly, therefore the name Wai-ʻoloʻio literally means swiftly moving
        water such as a waterfall. (Dickey 1915, Kelsy) While this name is not
        found on historical maps or in any of the currently digitized nupepa, it
        is thought that in this context Wai-olo-io could be in relation to the
        attributes of this particular waterfall after a large rain. The steady
        flow of water can swiftly move into rushing heavy brown waters.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, Wai-oloio is also said to be a stretch of water at the foot of
        Mauna Kapu (Kaʻiu) (Dickey). Kaʻiu also states that Wai-oloio is a
        stretch of the Wailua River where brother and sister rocks are.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Waiolo-io is also mentioned in a moʻolelo pertaining to the place,
        <em className="underlined">Ka-malu</em>, a pool of water (Kaʻiu)
        literally meaning, the shade.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        This pool was named for a moʻo who sometimes assumed the form of a
        chiefess, a woman of long brown hair sitting on the side of Kua-moʻo.
        The sister Poha-kū was the float of an outrigger canoe that came from
        Hawaiʻi and was borne up the Wailua river to Wai-oloio, where the house
        of Malu-aka first flew and spread over Wailua on both sides of the
        stream. (Wichman, Kaʻiu)

        However, in Judge Lyle Dickey also provides accounts of this waterfall
        using the name ʻŌpaekaʻa. In them he states:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        A little further up north on the ridge may be seen Waioloia or Opaikaa
        [Opaekaa] waterfall. Māui the demigod had his home just above the
        waterfall with his mother Hina at the time he attempted to pull all the
        islands together and discovered how to make fire from the alae hens. His
        jawbone (papaniho o Māui) is a little below the top of the hill. On the
        slopes of Mokua, the place where he lay his malo to dry out can be seen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        On both sides of this ridge are reminders of Maui, the demi-god. On the
        south side, in the water near the landing place of the [then] present
        poi factory is a stone called the fishing weight of Maui. To the north
        in Opaikaa [Opaekaʻa] Stream is a sharp stone, the canoe of Maui, also
        his fish hook Manaiikalani [Manaiakalani]. The horizontal strata marks
        on the northside of Opaikaa [Opaekaa] Stream are the marks made by the
        malo of Maui when put there to dry after he had been out fishing.

      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        Mauka, a little on this same ridge, is Poliahu heiau. This was built by
        the menehune who each brought up one stone for it from Opaikaa [Opaekaa]
        Stream. (Dickey, Year, Page)

        Wichman retells the story of Ka Paio o ʻŌpaekaʻa (translated as The
        Battle of ʻŌpaekaʻa) in his book{" "}

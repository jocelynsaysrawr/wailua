        Along the lower 2 miles of Wailua River, above the sandy costal plain,
        are many broad, open, level areas, formerly in terraces, now mostly in
        sugar. ʻŌpaekaa Stream, which flowers into tidewater Wailua River,
        watered many terraces both above and below that falls. The large area of
        terraces below the falls is now planted mostly in rice, a few of the
        upper terraces being used for sweet potatoes, while the uppermost are
        pasture.

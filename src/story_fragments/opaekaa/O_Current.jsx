        Today, the ‘Ōpaekaʻa is a major tourist attraction along Kuamoʻo road,
        pitched for its easy accessibility which includes a viewing platform to
        speculate, parking lot, and restrooms. Throughout the day large tour
        buses frequent this stop. In addition, in the past, there have been
        multiple tragedies from hikers seeking to climb to the bottom of the
        falls. For example, in 2006, two women fell some 300 feet. They were
        using an unmarked trail featured in some Hawaiʻi guidebooks. There is no
        state trail down to ‘Ōpaeka’a Falls either the top or the bottom.
        ʻŌpaekaʻa rises at about 690 ft. elevation at the base of Puʻu ʻŌpae;
        enters North Fork Wailua River near sea level and ʻŌpaekaʻa stream joins
        the Wailua River State Park about 0.6 miles inland of the shoreline.

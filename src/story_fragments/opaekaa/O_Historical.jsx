        Westerners tend to label broad landscape features with identifiable
        names, perhaps equating size with significance. Hawaiians adhered to no
        such constraints. Ethel Damon (1931), recognized and stated that in
        ancient times “every stone on the island had its meaning, every trail
        had its name.”{" "}

        The importance of place—and place names—in the Hawaiian culture is hard
        to overstate. Within a name are embedded hints about the location
        itself, whether it describes physical characteristics or events that
        occurred there. As Carlos Andrade, a professor of Hawaiian Studies at
        the University of Hawai‘i, has explained, a place name is like a
        personal name. “When people pronounce it wrong, it rankles. When they
        deliberately change it, it erases you from the world” (Griffin,
        2012:78).

        Historical Maps in created in the early 1900’s documented many place
        names. However, some of these early historical maps of Wailua
        demonstrates the common issue of not understanding place names and their
        meanings.

        done by Surveyor M.D. Monserrat it is uncertain if the spelling “Opaikaa
        Falls” instead of ʻŌpaekaʻa was deliberate or accidental through
        replacing vowels e to i because of the way they sound.

        ʻŌpae means shrimp, Kaʻa means to roll, the literal translation for
        ʻŌpaekaʻa is rolling shrimp and gets its name for the shrimp that once
        gathered at the pools formed at the base of the falls. (

        , Kaiʻu, Pukui, Elbert, Moʻokini) There is no definition for “Opai” or
        “Opaikaa”. Interestingly however, while Pai has multiple meanings, one
        of them is a funnel shaped wicker basket used for catching shrimps and
        small fish, so called because it was lifted (pai) from the water.

        Additionally, written in some of the Land Commission Awards (LCAs),
        ʻŌpaekaʻa stream may also be known as Ka-wai-iki. Iki means small,
        ka-wai means the water. Therefore Ka-wai-iki means small stream. When
        compared perpendicularly to its neighboring body of water, the Wailua
        River, it is considered significantly smaller.

        When looking at certain Land Commission Awards , Ka-wai-iki is called
        both a muliwai and stream. These claiments include Nahinu, Poka, and
        Kaumualiʻi. Specifically these LCA’s states that Ka-wai-iki was bounded

        Along the lower 2 miles of Wailua River, above the sandy coastal plain,
        are many broad, open, level areas, formerly in terraces, now mostly in

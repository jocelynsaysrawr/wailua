        Westerners tend to label broad landscape features with identifiable
        names, perhaps equating size with significance. Hawaiians adhered to no
        such constraints. Ethel Damon (1931), recognized and stated that in
        ancient times “every stone on the island had its meaning, every trail
        had its name.”{" "}

        The importance of place—and place names—in the Hawaiian culture is hard
        to overstate. Within a name are embedded hints about the location
        itself, whether it describes physical characteristics or events that
        occurred there. As Carlos Andrade, a professor of Hawaiian Studies at
        the University of Hawai‘i, has explained, a place name is like a
        personal name. “When people pronounce it wrong, it rankles. When they
        deliberately change it, it erases you from the world” (Griffin,
        2012:78).

        Historical Maps in created in the early 1900’s documented many place
        names. However, some of these early historical maps of Wailua
        demonstrates the common issue of not understanding place names and their
        meanings.

        done by Surveyor M.D. Monsarrat it is uncertain if the spelling “Opaikaa
        Falls” instead of ʻŌpaekaʻa was deliberate or accidental through
        replacing vowels e to i because of the way they sound.

        ʻŌpae means shrimp, Kaʻa means to roll, the literal translation for
        ʻŌpaekaʻa is rolling shrimp and gets its name for the shrimp that once
        gathered at the pools formed at the base of the falls. (Dickey, Kaiʻu,
        Pukui, Elbert, Moʻokini) There is no definition for “Opai” or “Opaikaa”.
        Interestingly however, while Pai has multiple meanings, one of them is a
        funnel shaped wicker basket used for catching shrimps and small fish, so
        called because it was lifted (pai) from the water.

        Additionally, written in some of the Land Commission Awards (LCAs),
        ʻŌpaekaʻa stream may also be known as Ka-wai-iki. Iki means small,
        ka-wai means the water. Therefore Ka-wai-iki means small stream. When
        compared perpendicularly to its neighboring body of water, the Wailua
        River, it is considered significantly smaller.

      <br />
      <p>
        When looking at certain Land Commission Awards , Ka-wai-iki is called
        both a muliwai and stream. These claiments include Nahinu, Poka, and
        Kaumualiʻi. Specifically these LCA’s states that Ka-wai-iki was bounded
        on the south side of LCA claim number 3909:1 by Nahinu (TMK 4101:6) and
        of LCA claim number 3405:1 by Poka (not awarded, TMK 4101:por.7). On the
        north and east sides Ka-wai-iki was bounded by LCA claim number 3561:2
        by Kaumualiʻi (not awarded, perhaps TMK 4101:1). Foreign testimony also
        state “This stream, is now known as ʻŌpaekaʻa” (Land Commission, Foreign
        Testimony 13:75,86,87).

        Land Commission Awards to a Kelani (LCA 3568) to and Deborah Kapule (LCA
        3111/3559:3), confirm that that Ka-wai-iki is not only an ʻili but also
        an ʻauwai.

        Based on a detailed study in 1935, Handy (1940:67-68) described Wailua
        as a very productive settlement area with extensive agricultural fields
        (Carson, 2005:64):

        Along the lower 2 miles of Wailua River, above the sandy costal plain,
        are many broad, open, level areas, formerly in terraces, now mostly in
        sugar. ʻŌpaekaa Stream, which flowers into tidewater Wailua River,
        watered many terraces both above and below that falls. The large area of
        terraces below the falls is now planted mostly in rice, a few of the
        upper terraces being used for sweet potatoes, while the uppermost are
        pasture.

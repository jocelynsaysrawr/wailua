        Historical Society and an advocate of preserving historic sites on
        Kauaʻi. On his surveying expeditions, he uncovered ancient Hawaiian
        landmarks that had lain under vegetation for decades, or even centuries,

        Hikina-a-ka-lā was robbed of many of its stones in the past two
        centuries so that only the larger boulders originally forming the wall

        upright adze stone at the site as a symbol of protection when the
        highway development threatened the area.

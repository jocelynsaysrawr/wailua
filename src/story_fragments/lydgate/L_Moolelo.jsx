        There are seven particularly sacred heiau along the Wailua river from
        sea to mountain top that are joined together: Hikina-a-ka-lā, Malae,
        Holoholokiʻi, Poli ʻahu, Pihanakalani (Wai-o-kaola), Kaʻawakō, and
        Kuakini. These were very sacred and are said to correspond to the seven
        nerve centers of the body.

        At the mouth of the river was a complex of important religious,
        political, and cultural sites. One of these sites was Puʻuhonua o
        Hauola, located on the heiau on the south side of the river mouth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Hau-ola</strong> literally means dew of life, and this heiau was
        known as a place of refuge for those fleeing from war or kapu breakers
        to be absolved of their infractions. After performing certain rituals,
        refuge-seekers were allowed to leave after several days (Joesting,1984,
        p.10). Dickey writes:

        Here a murder or one liable to death because of violating a kapu might
        flee from the pursuer and be safe. The gates were always open for the
        fugitives who rush in, hasten to the principle idol to think it for
        safety and after remaining within the walls a few days would be immune
        and might leave. Inside the walls were houses for the priests and for
        the refugees. There is also a pōhaku piko here. In the south eastern
        part is the heiau, Hikina-akala, a long, narrow, heiau, containing
        graves of a family that desecrated it by cultivating within its walls.
        It is reported that on the nights of Kāne. The sound of the drum ʻūkēkē,
        played by the spirits, may still be heard at Hauola.

      <p>Another account by Kaʻiu states:</p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        This was a place of refuge. Warriors defeated in war and their families,
        as well as anyone who had broken a taboo, might flee from pursuers and,
        once reaching this place, were safe. The gates were always open but no
        pursuer could enter after his intended victim. The refugee would give
        offerings to the gods, remain within the walls for a number of days, and
        then be free to leave and resume his/her life. No one dared resume
        punishment as that would have been a direct affront to the gods. Inside
        the walls there were houses for the priests and for refugees. There was
        also a pōhaku-piko where a leaf-wrapped afterbirth was placed for
        safekeeping. Here, also, those who had recovered from sickness (he wahi
        ho'oku'u ma'i) dove into the water five times. Hoʻokuʻu indicates
        purification after sickness.

        Whether it is a separate heiau from <strong>Hikinia-a-ka-la</strong> or
        two names for the same heiau is not clear. However, Hoʻomanawanui states
        “Hauola, considered a puʻuhonua (place of refuge), is located within the
        boundaries of Hikinaakalā.
      </p>
      <br />

        Hikina-a-ka-la means the rising of the sun and is located beside Hauola
        on the south side of the Wailua river mouth. According to Lahainaluna
        Student papers, this heiau was built by Wailuanui-a-hoʻāno soon after
        the Puna family came to Kaua'i from the Marquesas (Lahainaluna).

      <p>Additoinally she writes:</p>
      <br />
      <p className="indented">
        Three of the Wailua heiau are directly associated with Kāne, an
        important akua associated with freshwater, sunlight, and agriculture,
        especially kalo production. The first is Hikinaakalā (“The Rising Sun”),
        located on the easternmost point of the island on the south bank of the
        Wailua river mouth. Kanaka Maoli cultural practitioners continue to
        utilize the heiau and offer hoʻokupu (ceremonial gifts).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The location of the heiau and puʻuhonua being on the East side of the
        island,where the Wailua river flows down and meets the ocean was
        experienced as a protal or opening for the life-giving fertility forces
        of the rising sun. The east-west orientation of the site and the
        astronomical alignemnt of the sacred structures to scontelalltion and
        star such as Hōkūpaʻa, the north star, confirm this is a place of great
        mana.

        There were large carved wooden kiʻi (images) on the shore fronting the
        refuge and temple. Facing the sacred waterway, with arms and kapa cloth.
        The Pae-ki‘i-māhū also had a direct connection to this site.

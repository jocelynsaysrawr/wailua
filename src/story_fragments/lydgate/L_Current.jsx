        Lydgate beach park is heavily advertised as one of the “essential” and
        “best” beaches to visit on Kauaʻi. Both visitors and community enjoy
        this place. The park is known for being “Keiki heaven” or a beach for
        the family. Guidebooks and travel narratives will tell you the vast
        amenities Lydgate Beach Park contains. For instance, on the shore, there
        is a pair of enclosed man-made rock-rimmed pools/ponds, one large and
        the other small and shallow. A lifeguard on duty makes these pools safe
        for anyone to swim or snorkel at any time of the year. Additionally, the
        park includes fine picnic grounds, a pavilion for gatherings, soccer
        fields, walking, and bike paths as well as the Kamalani Playground and
        Kamalani Bridge built by community volunteers. This place that is now
        known as Lydgate Beach Park, a place for picnicers and beachgoers was
        once apart of a major religious center for Wailua. In over 700 years,
        the landscape of this area has undergone many changes. A portion of this
        built over the present day Aston Aloha Beach Resort.

        The land Thomas Brown acquired in Land Grant (#452) included 3 parcels

        #439003008), Mākea Lo‘i Complex (TMK #390030070000), both of which are
        currently owned by Kamehameha Schools, as well as, Haoma/ Kaoma (TMK
        #390030060000) the 9.83 acres of land where the cave sits, currently

        Thomas Brown (1804 - 1886) arrived from England to Kaua‘i with this wife
        Mary Ann Brown (1813 - 1900) and four children in early 1844 (Nellist
        1925). Mr. Brown was induced to come to Kaua‘i by Mrs. Brown’s brother
        Mr. Godfrey Rhodes, who was living in Hanalei at the time, being a
        pioneer coffee planter of the island. As an English farmer, Mr. Brown
        hoped to make a success of farming in the Hawaiian Islands. The Brown
        family stayed first in Hanalei. Around 1846 he was granted by Hawaiian
        government a 99-year lease on the Wailua lands with the purpose of
        building up a dairy farm and coffee plantation. The lease of these crown
        lands was made before the Land Commission. The holdings of these lands
        were said to cover a thousand acres or more, and were called or known as
        the Brown Estate, the Kumalu house, or Wailua Falls Mansion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On these parcels in Wailua (assumingly above Konolea and Makea), the
        Browns had a dairy farm, a coffee farm, and the first foreign built
        home. The house was said to have a superb view of the mountains and
        river, as well as a steep trail leading down to the bluff (Konolea) to
        the river’s edge. Visitors would come up on the Wailua river by canoe
        and used this path; Others came on horseback or by ox-cart. Mr. and Mrs.
        Brown brought with them the first magnolia tree on the Islands and said
        to have been planted on these lands (Garden Island 1915). In addition to
        the Magnolia, they also brought and planted there the heliotrope, Easter
        lihes, and the Durranta, a flowering shrub with a profusion of yellow
        berries.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 1848, Mr. Brown was forced to mortgage the Wailua Estate; the deed
        was made out to William L. Lee, Chief of Justice of the kingdom{" "}
        <a>(Damon 1883).</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although Mr. Brown had been successful with his dairy, his coffee
        plantings had been completely devoured by caterpillars.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 1852, schooling had become a matter of paramount importance for Mr.
        Brown’s three children and decided to take the family to New York (later
        returning to live in Honolulu). By July 10th, 1852 all his property and
        live-stock on the land were listed in an ad in The Polynesian newspaper
        for sale. At the time the property was for sale it was noted that there
        were orange trees on the estate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Although the whereabouts they existed was not specified, these orange
        trees were advertised to have yielded 30 to 40,000 fruit annually. They
        are also said to be some of the oldest orange trees in the islands which
        were still in flourishing condition on the estate till at least 1903.{" "}
        <a>(Higgins 1906: 6)</a>, <a>(Brown 1852: 31)</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the Brown family left Wailua, there seems to have been succession
        purchasers for the lease, who lived and managed these lands.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After the Brown’s moved away, the estate, including the herd, horses,
        sheep, etc. were sold for the price of $5,000 (Damon 1883). The first
        purchasers were Messieurs Montgomery and Turner. Alfred F. Turner was a
        nephew of the Brown’s, he lived and managed the ranch until early 1854,
        when he drowned at Wailua River.

        According to the <a>Garden Island Feb 11. 1919</a> “Those were the days
        when white women were scarce in the land, and very choice, and hard to
        get. On the other hand, Hawaiian maidens were plentiful, and some of
        them very comely, and not adverse to gallant attentions.” Young Turner
        became enamored of one of these Hawaiian women, who lived down at the
        mouth of the valley. In the evenings it was often his delight to hike
        down the bluff at Konolea, board his canoe and paddle downstream to
        spend the night with her. On one particular evening in Feb. of 1854 he
        left the ranch about sunset for his usual trip, got into his canoe at
        Konolea, and paddled down the river; He was never seen alive again.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When authorities questioned Hawaiians in the vicinity, they expressed
        certainty that “a mo‘o had dragged him down” into the river. According
        to their testimony, “Turner had been paddling at sunset in the bend of
        the river where mo‘o in the form of mermaids lived nearby in an
        underwater cavern. Suddenly, many of them appeared swimming in the water
        all around Turner’s canoe, pleading with him to come with them.” When
        Turner refused and attempted to escape, they climbed into his canoe,
        tied him with hau, and dragged him beneath the surface into their
        cavern. <a>(Soboleski 2006)</a>

        Note- Unterwater caves exsist on the Wailua River; One such is
        Kaluamōkila (“Mōkila cave”), a cave that extends north to south through
        Puʻukī near Holoholokū Heiau.The south entrance was located underwater
        in the Wailua River, and the north entrance on the hill. The moʻo
        (lizard) Mōkila was thought to reside here. Mōkila is also a Kauaʻi name
        for the needles used to string lei <a>(Wehewehe)</a>. Another underwater
        cave on the north bank of the Wailua River is called
        Kahaleokawelomahamahaiʻa (The Home of Kawelo with Fish Gills){" "}
        <a>(Hoʻomanawanui 2012, 225-226)</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A couple of days later, when Turner’s body was discovered (caught in a
        fish net set across the river), no evidence of foul play was observed —
        Turner’s pockets had not been rifled, nor was his watch taken. It was
        reported in the <a>Garden Island (2006)</a>, however, “Turner probably
        was the victim of a jealous rival for his girlfriend’s affections, but
        without proof of this, a coroner’s jury of inquest investigating his
        death delivered a verdict of death by accidental drowning, case closed.”
        Turner was buried not far from Brown’s mansion.

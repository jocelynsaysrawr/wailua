                <p>
                As a community, let us move forward in a positive way; Below are ways to preserve, care for, and protect our places from the tangible and intangible impacts to these sites. By practicing these behaviors and modeling these values, we set the standard for our keiki and the future generations, so that they too can not only to continue experience these places but understand their importance.

                <h3>On Visiting Hawaiian Sites</h3>
                <p>

                The sites described and illustrated in this web-app were specifically selected because they are accessible to the public, although some cases with restrictions. Most of the sites have been landscaped and modified so as to accommodate visitors, with parking areas, accessible/ interpretive trails, and markers. Regardless of whether a site is supervised, there are a few basic rules that should govern behavior and activities of visitors to all Hawaiian and archaeological sites.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <strong>BEHAVE APPROPRIATELY-</strong> Above all keep in mind these sites represent a cultural heritage of the native Hawaiian people, and as such deserve great respect. This is especially so for religious sites, such as various heiau or place of worship. Heiau are highly sacred places, which only the aliʻi (high ranking chiefs) and kahuna (priests) would once enter. These sites continue to be regarded as sacred wahi pana (storied places). They are imbued with mana, and continue to have great significance to the native Hawaiian people. Many sites continue to be actively used for religious observances. The visitor should behave and act in these places as one would in any other place of worship.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>STAY ON DESIGNATED PATHS-</strong> Remember to treat Hawaiian constructions and sites as fragile constructions. Stone walls and terrace facing that make up many sites were laid without the use of mortar and can easily tumble or collapse. The walls enclosing heiau and house sites were never intended by their makers to be walked upon, and visitors should keep off such constructions at all times. Many sites have foot trails designed for visitors- please stay on these and observe all signs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>DO NOT DEFACE-</strong> Kiʻi or Petroglyph rock art sites are especially fragile and vulnerable to defacement, and many significant petroglyphs have already suffered irreversible damage. Never apply any substance to a petroglyph, not even chalk. Rubbings are also destructive, as these can stain and/or bruise the fragile lava.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>DO NOT REMOVE-</strong> Never remove anything from an archaeological site; removing stones is not only immoral, it is illegal as well. If you should happen to observe an artifact or other culturally significant material on site (for example, exposed by erosion), leave it in place and report your observation as soon as possible either to the steward, caretaker of the land, ranger, staff person, or the the local State Historic Preservation Division. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>DO NOT REARRANGE-</strong> Do not rearrange or modify an archaeological site in any way. This includes the practice of wrapping stones in kī-leaves as informal offerings (otherwise known as “pōhaku laulau”). Contrary to the popular belief, this practice is not part of traditional Hawaiian ritual (although the use of kī-leaves in ritual is an ancient polynesian practice), and only leads to the rearrangement of paving and wall stones, thus destroying the integrity of the archaeological remains.

                <p>
                Information directly quoted from  State Archives- Henry E.P. Kekahuna (M-86_Folder 484), written by Theodore Kelsy

                <p>
                Mr. E.H. Bryan, Jr., is undertaking a commendable work by repriting, perhaps with alterations, Hawaiian Place Names, by Thomas G. Thrum, appended to the Andrews-Parker Hawaiian Dictionary. Unfortunately the name list, like the dictionary, bristles with mistakes. If not corrected these mistakes are likely to become “authority”, and be repeated again and again.

                <p>
                Though it is true that we lack the background of incident and legend, almost completely lost, that would enable us to give the real meaning of names, we nevertheless can and should correct definite misunderstandings and supply reasonable interpretations.

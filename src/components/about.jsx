            <h1>About the Ahupuaʻa of Wailua</h1>
            <p>
            For over twenty years, Kaua‘i has been portraited and branded in the tourism industry as the
“Island of Discovery,” or more recently the “Island of Rejuvenation” where both themes elicit a
sense of excitement, exoticism, “native” hospitality, romanticism, perfection, and nostalgia
promoting the commodification of Native Hawaiian culture.
            </p>
            <p>
            The lands of Wailua in the Puna district on Kauaʻi island were lived in over the course of
generations. They were once known and recognized as a sacred wahi pana, home to some of
Kauaʻi’s highest ranking aliʻi (royals) with highlighted features and place names celebrated in
oral traditions. However, over the past century and a half, the traditional narratives for Wailua
that gave this place and its community identity has been transformed by settler colonial outside
interests, with the tourism industry driving the creation of its image and sense of place.
            </p>
            <p>
            Wailua is the largest of the fifteen windward ahupuaʻa (socio-political land units) that comprise the district of Puna, and contains 20,255 acres that was once divided into two parts, Wailua Makai, which contained 2,800 acres and Mauka. Wailua Makai was known as Wailua-nui-ʻaho-ano and was the seat of political power as well as one of the most sacred regions for the Kauaʻi chiefdom.
            </p>
            <p>
            As important wahi pana (storied place), it is unique in the sense that it has the longest navigable river (32 km) in our homeland, formed by the confluence of its north and south forks and numerous permanent and semi-permanent streams and tributaries that begin near Waiʻaleʻale, the wettest spot on Earth and that drains into a vast productive inland agricultural region.
            </p>
            <p>
            Along the major geographical feature, Wailua River, are alluvial flats which were once used for agricultural cultivation in the prehistoric period, found along with a number of significant sacred sites and features, including burials, heiau, birthing stones (Pōhaku hānau), a bell stone (Pōhaku kani), fishponds (Loko i‘a), canoe landings (Pae Wa‘a), and petroglyphs (Ki‘i pōhaku: Pae Ki‘i Mahu) some of which can still be seen today.
            </p>
            <p>
            The five focus sites highlighted within the Wailua ahpuaʻa are considered the highest “places of impact” that are under immediate threat currently being well-known sites of increased amounts of exposure, recreation, impact and/ or traffic. These sites include, Opaekaʻa Falls (Wai-olo-io), Fern Grotto (Māmā-akua-lono), Wailua Beach, Wailua River, and Lydgate Beach Park.
